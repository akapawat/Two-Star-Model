# Two-Star-Model
This is a program to sample Gibbs distribution of the two-star model, one of the model in Exponential Random Graph Model (ERGM) family, using metropolis algorithm. This is part of my undergraduate thesis at Chulalongkorn University. The aim of this program is to reproduce the study of the two-star in dense regime and sparse regime, done by Park and New man 2004 and Annibale and Courtney 2015 respectively. However, it can run other model in ERGM family with only small adjudments.
